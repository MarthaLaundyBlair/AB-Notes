Java Web Technologies
---------------------

Servlet API 

JSP API - Java Server Pages

JSF - Java Server Faces


What is a website?

-> A collection of webpages

-> A website may have one or more webpages


Types of websites?
------------------

1) Static

	-> Non-Responsive
	
	-> Used to publish data/information
	
	-> Mainly used to adverts
	
	-> To build static websites we use 
	
		HTML & CSS
	
2) Dynamic


    -> Responsive, because the content of dynamic websites is generated 
	
	   based on user interaction or input
	   
	   
	Examples:
	
	   Online shopping application /eCommerce application 
	   
	   Online Banking application 
	   
	   
	-> Used to trade online 


    -> To build dynamic websites we use tools/tech stack 

		Servlet & JSP API
		
		ASP - Active Server Pages
		
		PHP - Personal Home Page / Pre-processor Home Page

        Django for Python Developers		
		
		
	

What is a Servlet?


-> A servlet is a Java web component which can generate 
   the dynamic content
   
   
What is a Servlet API?

-> An API which provides several classes and interfaces that help 
   programmer to develop dynamic websites in Java domain   
   
   
   
How can we a new Servlet in Java?

There are many ways to create servlets such as 


  1) A servlet can be created by implementing an interface called "Servlet"
     and override the methods of servlet interface
	 
	 Servlet interface is available in a package called "javax.servlet"	 
	 
  
  2) Can be created by extending "GenericServlet" class 
  
  
  3) Can be created by extending "HttpServlet" class (Recommended)
  
  
  
What is Servlet Lifecycle?


Servlet lifecycle includes three methods (callback methods or lifecycle methods)  

  1) init(ServletConfig config)
	
     -> This method is called when the servlet component is first loaded 

     -> this method is used to initialize the servlet component	 
	 
	 -> init method is called only once
  
  
  2) service(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res)
  
	 -> This method is called everytime there is a new request from client/browser
	 
	 -> Execution per request
	 
  
  3) destroy()
  
     -> This method is called just before the servlet (servlet object/instance) is removed from the
	    container
		
		
		

Tools required to develop a dynamic website using Java Web Technologies
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Java compatable IDE 

	Eclipse 
	
	IntelliJ
	
	VS Code
	
	NetBeans
	
	
Web Server/Application Server

   Apache Tomcat
   
   
NOTE: If you attempt to start Apache tomcat server through 
       
     ./bin folder and startup.bat file 
	 
	 
	 And experience Tomcat window comes and disappears - you have to fix this
	 

    Create an Environment Variable called "JAVA_HOME"
	
	
	JAVA_HOME = 
	




Servlets act as Controllers where all requests are processed and response is sent 
   through either servlet itself (bad practice) 
   or through HTML/JSP files (Good practice)
   
  
Writing HTML code in Servlet makes the component/servlet more complex and not 
	readable
