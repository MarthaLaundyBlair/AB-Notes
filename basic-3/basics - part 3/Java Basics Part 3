Stack 
  Stack is a memory location where all 
  local variables/parameters of a methods reside
	
	
Heap 
	All Java object exist on Heap 
	

Garbage Collector (GC)

	A tool which is responsible for removing unused objects from Heap
	
	
	
	
	
What is a method?

-> A block of code which can be declared once and called many times 


public static void main(String[] args){

Syntax:

   [access modifier] [Static modifier] <return type> methodName([parameter-list]){
   
	   // Body of the method
   
   }



  Example:
  
  public void add(int a,int b){
  
	System.out.println( a + b );
  }
	
	

	
What is a method call?

-> A call to an existing method


Syntax:

  methodName([argument-list]);	

 
  Example:
  
  add(10,20)

  add(100,200);
  
  add(1000,2000);
  
  
  
  System.out.println();
	
	
NOTE: Methods allow us to write re-usable code 

Methods provide a way to write maintainable code
  
	


What is a method overloading?

-> When two or more methods have same name with different parameters is called as 
   method overloading
   
   
   Different parameter-list means 

   1) Number of parameters should be different 
   2) Datatypes of parameters should be different

  Examples:

  1)
  void add(int a,int b){


  }
  
  2)
  
  void add(double d1, double d2){
  
  }
  
  3)
  void add(int a,int b, int c){
  
  
  }
  
  4)
  int add(int x, int y){
  
  
  }
  
  
  1 & 2 => Overloaded
  
  1 & 3 => Overloaded 
  
  1 & 4 => 
  
  

  Best example:
  
  println() method in Java has been overloaded




What is a constructor?

-> A constructor method which is syntatically similar to method but
    it lacs return type
	
-> Constructor will always have same name as class name in which it is declared


-> This is invoked immediately upon creating of object


-> Constructors can be overloaded


What is an Encapsulation?

-> A process of combining variables and methods into a logical unit (class)


-> Encapsulation suggests that the variables should be declared as "private"

   and methods as "public"
