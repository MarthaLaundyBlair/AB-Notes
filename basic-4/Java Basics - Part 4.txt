What is Inheritance?

-> A process of creating a new class from an existing class 

-> Inheriting the attributes/properties/fields from a different class 

-> Aquiring properties from a different class


Types of Inheritance
--------------------

1) Single 

2) Multi-level 

   class A{
   
   
   }
   class B extends A{
   
   }
   class C extends B{
   
   }
   
   
3) Multiple - Java does not support this


   class A {
   
	  int x;
   }
   
   
   class B {
   
      int x;
   }
   
   class C extends A,B {
   
   
   
   }
   
   
   NOTE: A class cannot extend more than once class
   
   
4) Hybrid Inheritance - Combination of Multi-level and
					multiple
					
	Java does not support this type 
	
	
	class D {}
	
	class A {}
   
    class B extends A {}
   
    class C extends B,D {}



5) Hierarchical Type  - Java Supports this type


   class A {}
   
   class B extends A{
   
   }
   class C extends A{
   
   
   }
   
	


What is an abstract class?

-> A class with one or more abstract methods 
   is called as abstract class
   
   
   
-> A class which has no complete implementation 
  


-> An abstract class can have abstract and concrete methods


-> If a class extends an abstract class it must override all abstract methods 
   defined in it's superclass
   
   
-> Abstract cannot be instantiated


   Example:
   
   Pet p1 = new Pet(); // Error
