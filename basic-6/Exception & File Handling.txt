Exception Handling

What is an Exception?

-> A runtime error


Clauses of Exception Handling
-----------------------------

1) try 

   Program statements that are expected to throw exception should
   be written in try block   

2) catch 

   Exceptions thrown by try block are sent to a "matching" catch block

3) throw

   To throw exceptions manually we use "throw" clause
   
   NOTE: By default JRE/JVM throws Exceptions implicitly
   	

4) throws 

   -> this clause is used to indicate that a method may throw exception
   
   -> It is always a part of method declaration/definition (Worker)
    

5) finally / finally block

   It is a guaranteed block which gets executed regardless of exception state 
   
	(Exception is Handled or Not)
	
	(Exception is raised or Not)




ArithmeticException


ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException




-> A try block can have more than one catch blocks (try - with multi-catch)



-> Hierarchy of Exception classes
   ------------------------------
   
Super class for all Java classes is "Object"


Super class for all Java Exceptions is "Throwable"




What are unchecked exceptions?

-> These exceptions are unchecked by the compiler - which means your code need not handle 
   these exceptions using try-catch block


What are checked exceptions?

-> These exceptions are checked by the compiler - which means your code must handle these
   exceptions using try - catch block or declared to be thrown



How can we create user-defined exceptions in Java?
Steps involved in creating UD exceptions in Java?


Step 1) Create an exception class by extending "Exception" (pre-defined class)


Step 2) Declare a String variable which can an exception message


Step 3) Write a parameterized constructor which takes String as an argument 


Step 4) Override toString() method






What is @Override?

-> An pre-defined annotation which is used to indicate that 

   a method is defined in a super type and subclass is overriding it










File Handling
-------------

What is a File?

-> Something stored on a disk 


NOTE:

In Java programming we should be able to create files, read and write content 
  to and from files using set of classes and interfaces
  
  
  
NOTE: Java provides a package called "java.io" where most of the file handling classes 
  and interfaces are defined/declared
  
  
  
NOTE: Java file handling classes are classified into two types 



     1) Byte Stream Classes 

        These classes deal with sequence of bytes
		
		Byte Stream classes do not support UNICODE
		
		

     2) Character Stream classes	


		These classes deal with sequence of characters 

        These classes support UNICODE
