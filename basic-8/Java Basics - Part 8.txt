try - with resources 


Java 7 introduced this concept by which the resources created in 
  try(resources..........){
  
  }
  
  are closed implcitly/automatically so we don't need to write 
  finally block
  
  
  Resources like - file connection/stream or database connection 
     or any closeable object
	 
Try-with resources is an alternative to "finally" block

NOTE:

Can we write a try block without catch block?

Yes

  Try block must have at lease one catch block or a finally block or try-with-resources



Abstract class Vs Interface


Interface - only abstract methods

          - Allows us to implements a concept like multiple inheritance
		  
		  NOTE -> Interface is not suitable for variable re-usability 
		  
		          because variables of interface are "final"
				  
				  
Abstract Class:

        -> If there is a need of inheritance (variable re-usability)

        -> If you need to write abstract and concrete methods 

        -> If there is no need of multiple inheritance


       NOTE: Once a class extends an abstract class it can no longer extend another class


Interfaces are suitable for method re-usability

Abstract class is mpre suitable for variable re-usability

In real-world scenarios we use both because they both their own significance
