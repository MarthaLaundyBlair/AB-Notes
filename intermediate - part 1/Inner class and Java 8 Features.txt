What is an inner class?

-> A class which is enclosed in an another class

-> Inner class is also known as nested class


Types of Inner classes
----------------------

1) Non-static inner class 


2) Static Inner class 


3) Anonymous Inner class 


4) Local Inner class




Java 8 Features
---------------


1) Functional Programming through lambda expression
     or lamdba function or anonymous function
	 
	 
	Benifits:
	   
	   -> Avoids boiler-plate 
	   -> Makes your code more eligant and concise
	   -> We can write first class function / Pure functions 
		   Pure functions means a function with no side effects
	   -> Deals with functions that never carry any state
	   -> Encourage us to write declarative code (eligant and concise)
	   -> Deals with functional interfaces
	   
	  

  Vs Object Oriented Programming	  
  
  
      -> May include more boiler-plate code
	  
	  -> May expose too much business logic
	  
	  -> Deals with objects where objects may have mutable state sometimes
	  
	  -> Mutable state of objects may lead to inconsistent results
		   
      -> Encourage us to write Imperative code (this reveals too much business logic) 
	   




What are the building blocks of a Java method?

or 

What is the syntax of Java method?


1) Access Specifier/Modifier

2) Return Type

3) Method Name 

4) Parameter-list

5) Block of code


NOTE: According to Lambda expression 1, 2, 3 are not allowed because all these are are inferred 
			by Java programming system
			
	  
	  It means a lambda expression will have parameter-list and block of code (4 and 5 from the above list) 



    Syntax of Lambda expression/function
	
	
	
	[([parameter-list])] -> Block of code
	
	
	
	
What is a functional interface in Java?

-> An interface which defines one and only one abstract method

Can we write more than one method in a functional interface?

-> Yes it is possible but the methods have to be default or static methods
