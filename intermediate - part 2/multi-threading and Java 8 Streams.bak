What is a thread?

-> A way to execute a program (Java program/application)


What is multi-threading?


-> A process of dividing a program into different small parts 

   and running them concurrently 
   
   
   Benifits:
   
   Improves the performance by utilizing the CPU time effectively
   
   Light-weight process
   
   Context switching is simple
   
   
NOTE: Before you consider using multi-threading make sure you understanding the 
      problem and system's hardware   
   
   
How can we create threads in Java?

-> 1) Creating a thread (class) by extending Thread class and override run() method

-> 2) Creating a class by implementing Runnable interface and override run() method

-> 3) Creating a class by implementing Callable interface and override call() method

   

NOTE: -> With Thread class "extends" is closed for future inheritance because 

	   a Java class can extend one and only one class
	   
	  
      -> With Runnable or  Callable interfaces "extends" is still open	because 

      class implements one or more interfaces	  
	   


Can you list of some of the methods defined in Thread class?

-> start()

   run()
   
   setName 
   
   getName
   
   currentThread
   
   join 
   
   sleep
   
   setPriority 
   
   getPriority
   
   
   
What is a Thread life-cycle?

See the picture


What are thread priorities in Java?


Thread priorities are in range 1 - 10


    t1.setPriority(10); // MAX
	
	
	t1.setPriority(1); // MIN
	
Default Priority of a Java thread is 5 	



What is Race Condition in Multithreading?


-> When two or more thread attempt to 
   access a shared object/target then the 
   thread may enter into a race condition
	

  NOTE: Race condition is one of the challenges 
       associated with multi-threading



  NOTE: To avoid race condition Java provides various options 
        such as 
		
		
		1) synchronized methods
		
		2) synchronized blocks
		
		3) Re-entrant locks 
		
		4) Atomic wrapper classes
		
		5) "volatile" keyword
		



Challenges associated with multithreading


1) Race Condition 

2) Starvation

3) LiveLock

4) Deadlock




What is your understanding of Java 8 Streams?


Streams are sequence of objects/values that can be filtered/manipulated/processed for
business use-cases



What is a Stream Pipeline?


-> A Stream Pipeline includes 3 parts 


   1) Data Source
      
	  A stream pipeline can have one and only one data source
   
   2) Intermediate Operations 
   
      Stream Pipeline can have ZERO or more intermediate operations
   
   
   3) Terminal Operation
    
	  A stream pipeline can have one and only one terminal operations
