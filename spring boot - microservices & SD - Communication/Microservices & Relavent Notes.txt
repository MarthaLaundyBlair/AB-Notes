What is the difference a Web application/website & Web Service?


Web Application generates the content which is sent directly to end-users/browsers


Web Service generates data/content which is sent directly to an application
	(web application, Mobile App or some other application)
	
	
	Examples:
	
		https://www.skyscanner.net/ is a web application that uses/consumes data generated by web services 
		
			BA - Web Service - may fetch data from MySQL
			
			
		
		https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather is a web application that uses/consumes data generated by web services 
		
		
		   Web Services provided by different vendors - may fetch data from Oracle or SQL Server or MongoDB
		
	
	Features:
	
	Interoperability:
	
		Web Services can accessed from any programming language as long as there is access to 
		
		end-points (URL/URI)
	
	Designated to provide/generate data - the data may be stored in different databases

	Light-weight (Eg: RESTful web services) because it mainly focuses serving data
	


Can a web service communicate with another web service?

YES - Regardless of language where the web service is written or accessed



What is meant by Microservice?


A service which focuses on one module/sector

It is an idea which enables the developers to divide an application
into different services/parts and deploy them on seperate servers

  Examples:
  
     Product Module can be a service/application which can run on a specific 
	 server
	 
	 Customer Module may be deployed on a different server 
	 
	 
  Advantages of this model/approach
  ---------------------------------


     1) Better scalability options available
	 
	 
		Only designated server should scaled up or down where traffic spike or dip is encountered
		
		Types of Scalability options
		
			a) Virtical Scaling 
			
				If the same server is upscaled with more hardware resources like
				
				CPUs/ RAM or HDD
			
			b) Horizontal Scaling
			
			   If the another server is purchased to increase the capacity like 
			   memory or processing power
		
		
     2) Efficient maintainability

		Example: 
				
			If a module code (Product Module) changes only this modules needs to be 
			rebuild, test and deploy without dealing with other modules 
	 
      
  

What is the difference between Microservice Architecture and Monolithic Architecture?


In Monolithic Architecture the application is treated as one bit giant file (jar/war/ear) and 
deployed on a single server

	Challenges:
	
		Maintainability issues 
		Scalability issues
		
		
		
In Microservice Architecture the application is divided into different parts/services and 
deployed on multiple servers





How a RESTful service can communitate with another RESTful Web Service running on a different server?


We can use RestTemplate which is provided Spring framework and call a method like 

		exchange(......)




Service Discovery & Communication

	1) Spring Cloud & Netflix Eureka Server 

	2) Apache Kafka
	
	
	
	Types of SD and Communication
	
			1) Client-side (Spring Cloud supports client-side service discovery)
			
			2) Server-Side
